<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Data Transformation / Cleaning
#### All data transformation and cleaning was made with PowerQuery as follows:

- Browser, OS, City, Country and Referrer columns deleted. All of them are not relevant to the project's purpose and had no data.

- Q1 Column were the answer was "Other" was standarized to just show "Other" rather than, for example, "Other: Account Manager".

- The same was donde for Q5 and Q11, standarizing programming languages and Countries.

- Column "Average Salary" was created using Q3 column, were people selected their salary based on a range.

## Dashboard Creation
#### The following metrics are the ones being analyzed. Needless to say, there's much more metrics that we can analyze, but we can have a pretty good overview of what the survey has to offer:

- Favorite Programming Language.

- Average Salary by Job Title.

- Average Salary by Gender.

- Salary and Work&Life Balance Happiness.

- Average Age.

- Survey Takers.

- Country of Voters.

## Conclusions Made From Metrics
#### Looking at the Dashboard, here's some of the conclusions we can get:

- There's a pretty big preference for Python as the favorite programming language, covering a 66% of the total surveyed. Python is followed by R, with just 16%.

- Furthermore R and Python are used mainly for Data related jobs. Considering this, we could say that 82% of the surveyed are working in Data related jobs.

- We can see a strong correlation between the average salary of each job and the programming language they use. The top 3 highest paying jobs (in average), are data related. Clearly it is not a coincidence that people tend to use data driven languages.

- I find personally low that Salary happiness is 4.27/10. I would have expected a much more higher number taking into consideration that the tech industry has generally high paying positions.

- I'm not surprised to see a Work&Life balance happiness of 5.74. This is strongly connected with the salary happiness. My conclusion is people believe they should be getting payed more than what they are right now because they find the Work&Life balance is not what they expect. If companies are not negotiating this, they should be paying more. If they are not considering paying more, they should leand towards more Life than Work.

- I was pleasently surprised to see the average salary by gender is pretty much balanced out, even a little bit more on the upper side for the females. I would have expected a much higher average for males than for females (like India).
